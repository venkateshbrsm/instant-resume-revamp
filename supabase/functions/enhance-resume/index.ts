ORIGINAL RESUME TEXT:
${originalText}

CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULES - FAILURE TO FOLLOW WILL RESULT IN REJECTION:
1. PRESERVE EXACT COUNT: Count every work experience entry in the original resume and include EXACTLY the same number
2. PRESERVE EXACT SENTENCES: For each work experience, count every bullet point/sentence in the original and rewrite EXACTLY the same number
3. PRESERVE STRUCTURE: Keep the same job titles, companies, and date ranges as the original
4. PRESERVE MEANING: Each rewritten sentence must convey the same core meaning as the original
5. ONLY ENHANCE LANGUAGE: Your job is ONLY to make the language more ATS-friendly and professional

WORK EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT PROCESS:
For each work experience entry:
1. COUNT the original bullet points/achievements/sentences
2. REWRITE each one individually to be more ATS-friendly
3. ENSURE you have the EXACT same count of enhanced sentences
4. DO NOT combine, split, or omit any original sentences
5. DO NOT add new sentences beyond what exists in the original

ENHANCEMENT TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLES:
Original: "Helped customers with inquiries"
Enhanced: "Provided exceptional customer service and technical support to resolve client inquiries, ensuring satisfaction and retention through proactive communication and problem-solving expertise"

Original: "Managed social media accounts"
Enhanced: "Orchestrated comprehensive social media marketing strategies across Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter platforms, driving engagement and brand awareness through content creation and community management"

Original: "Worked with team on projects"
Enhanced: "Collaborated with cross-functional teams utilizing Agile methodologies and project management tools to deliver high-quality results within budget and timeline constraints"

STRICT COUNTING REQUIREMENTS:
- If original has 3 work experiences → output EXACTLY 3 work experiences
- If original work experience has 4 bullet points → output EXACTLY 4 enhanced bullet points
- If original work experience has 2 sentences → output EXACTLY 2 enhanced sentences
- NO EXCEPTIONS - maintain exact numerical parity

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST BEFORE RESPONDING:
□ Counted original work experiences and matched exactly
□ Counted sentences/bullets in each work experience and matched exactly  
□ Preserved all job titles, companies, and dates from original
□ Enhanced language for ATS without changing core meaning
□ Used strong action verbs and industry keywords
□ Maintained professional tone throughout
□ Included quantifiable metrics where appropriate
□ Ensured JSON structure is valid and complete
